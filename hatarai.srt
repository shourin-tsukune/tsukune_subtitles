1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
大家好，我是月見大人。

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
雖然很多人可能不認識我，但我一直在福岡從事服飾店工作直到一月。

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
幸運的是我能在店裡舉辦畢業活動，所以拍了這支影片紀錄我工作的最後一天。

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
我的桌面頻道

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
不好意思。

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
早安。

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
這是我今天的穿搭。

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
我拿到了自己的畢業紀念限定T恤，所以就穿上這套搭配。

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
是不是很可愛？

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
我還把頭髮弄成符合這套風格的造型。

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
今天我會拜託朋友幫我拍攝。

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
我要去剪頭髮了。

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
這真的好可愛。

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's so cute.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's like purple.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's shiny.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,880
I put a lot of my favorite characters on my

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,000
eyebrow.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is why my shoulders are always bent.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Cute.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's shaking a lot.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's the same as the illustration.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, I was conscious.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was going to make it two, but I was running too much.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ran too much.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Cute.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Many customers came to my store right away.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm grateful.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My job is mainly to take photos and post them on social media.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think the fun part of being a customer is that I can choose the special clothes of each customer.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I feel happy to hear good news such as the participation clothes of my favorite idol, the clothes I wear on dates, and the clothes I got praised for the day after tomorrow.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was talking seriously, but it was a very meaningful job.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to buy the clothes and go to the store.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Cute.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm so happy to hear good news.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I remember that I have to close my eyes.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll give you a tear bag.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to close my eyes.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Cute.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think the top part is cute.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I took photos of the time during the graduation event and gave them autographs and dates.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I like this smell.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm writing my name on this day.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't think it's dry. I'll give you this.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Super?

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't have much.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's just a little.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I took two photos with my smartphone and talked with the customers who came to see me.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to buy clothes.

56

I was happy to talk with many customers who were friendly.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I was too conscious of them and made a mistake.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I wrote "Wan" on the cat.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I was stupid to write "Wan" on the cat.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I was stupid to write "Wan" on the cat.

71
